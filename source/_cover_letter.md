To Whom it May Concern-

I teach technology for policy at two New York universities and always tell my students the same thing: Making government work for people is hard. Making government software that works for people is harder. I know this because over the last 11 years I have worked to improve systems and processes across every level of government:

- **Federal:** Census Bureau - [xD](https://xd.gov/); General Services Administration (GSA) - [18F](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/18F) & [Technology Transformation Services (TTS)](https://tts.gsa.gov/)
- **State:** Colorado Behavioral Health Administration; California Department of Transportation (CalTrans)
- **Local** (NYC): [Department of City Planning](https://www.nyc.gov/content/planning/pages/resources); Office of Technology and Innovation (OTI) - NYC Digital Service

For better or worse, my NYC Digital Service experience provided some of the most painful lessons. I led the NYC [MyCity](https://mycity.nyc.gov/) project's initial research around [small business formation](https://nyc-business.nyc.gov/nycbusiness/). I worked with the Mayor's Office and Small Business Services to understand the landscape, looking for points in the process where technology could help reduce [administrative burden](https://www.russellsage.org/publications/book/administrative-burden).

The Digital Service built a minimum viable product (MVP) using [agile principles](https://agilemanifesto.org/), working iteratively based on user research, but when it was almost ready to launch, the leadership of OTI pulled the plug on the team, throwing the work and the in-house expertise aside. Instead, they [turned to vendors](https://www.gothamgazette.com/130-opinion/11948-mayor-adams-nyc-it-tech-bureaucracy-mycity), taking a year to gather requirements in giant spreadsheets — without talking to any users, as far as I'm aware. They were digitizing bad processes. OTI / the vendor(s) then locked NYC into expensive Salesforce licenses indefinitely. [$100M+ later](https://nysfocus.com/2025/03/19/mycity-eric-adams-child-care), the site is a fraction of what was promised.

Making government software is hard. When the government outsources its expertise and follows the [waterfall model](http://localhost:4567/cover-letter), it's harder. I don't blame the vendors --- they were following incentives, doing what they were asked, falling back to an antiquated way of building software ([waterfall](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waterfall_model)) because it seemed "safe." New Yorkers deserve better.

I'm excited about the Mamdani administration's ambitious goals to make the city more affordable and equitable, and I want to be part of delivering them. I'm interested in a technology leadership role where I can guide complex projects to become the [excellent services that New Yorkers deserve](https://techmayor.nyc/p/about-the-tech-mayor-project). This will include:

- [Hiring more engineers, designers, and product managers into city government](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1EFbzYUcDx7fWn0HMuNmEtmo0PBIU45qpGxjzAH1aO_k/edit?usp=sharing), who can work with existing staff and vendors to ensure good engineering, product, and design practices across the board
- Empowering new and existing government staff (and yes, vendors), ensuring they have what they need to do their best work
- Basing decisions on data, grounded in direct, public user research
- Working collaboratively with internal and external stakeholders
- Increasing the city's commitment to open source and open data

Thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely,
