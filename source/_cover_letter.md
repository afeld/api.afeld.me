To Whom it May Concern-

Making government work for people is hard. Making government software that works for people is harder. I know this, because over the last 11 years, I have worked to improve systems and processes across every level of government:

- Federal
  - Census Bureau
    - [xD](https://xd.gov/)
  - General Services Administration (GSA)
    - [18F](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/18F)
    - [Technology Transformation Services (TTS)](https://tts.gsa.gov/)
- State
  - Colorado
    - Behavioral Health Administration
    - Colorado Digital Service
  - California
    - Department of Transportation (CalTrans)
- Local (NYC)
  - Department of City Planning
    - [Planning Labs](https://www.nyc.gov/content/planning/pages/resources)
  - Office of Technology and Innovation (OTI)
    - NYC Digital Service

(I may hold the record of having worked at the most government digital service teams…?)

One project I worked on was NYC's [MyCity](https://mycity.nyc.gov/), leading the project's initial research around [small business formation](https://nyc-business.nyc.gov/nycbusiness/). I worked with the Mayor's Office and Small Business Services to understand the landscape of agencies that are involved, looking for points in the process where technology could help reduce [administrative burden](https://www.russellsage.org/publications/book/administrative-burden).

The Digital Service was building a minimum viable product (MVP) using [agile principles](https://agilemanifesto.org/), working iteratively based on user research. When it was almost ready to launch, the leadership of OTI pulled the plug on the team, throwing the work and the in-house expertise aside. Instead, they [turned to vendors](https://www.gothamgazette.com/130-opinion/11948-mayor-adams-nyc-it-tech-bureaucracy-mycity), taking a year to gather requirements (without talking to any users) then locking NYC into expensive Salesforce licenses indefinitely. [$100M+ later](https://nysfocus.com/2025/03/19/mycity-eric-adams-child-care), the site is a fraction of what was promised.

<!-- Making government software is hard. When the government outsources its expertise and follows the [waterfall model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waterfall_model), it's harder. I don't blame the vendors — they were following incentives, falling back to [antequated way of building software (waterfall)](), doing what they were asked … instead of what was best for the city. -->

Making government software is hard. When the government outsources its expertise and follows the [waterfall model](), it's harder. I don't blame the vendors — they were following incentives, doing what they were asked, falling back to an antiquated way of building software ([waterfall](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waterfall_model)) because it seemed "safe". This, unfortunately, was not what was best for the project or the city.

<!-- In parallel, leadership had been having a vendor spend a whole year gathering requirements — internally, not speaking with a single business owner — to then hand the project off to Salesforce and other large vendors. [$100M later](https://nysfocus.com/2025/03/19/mycity-eric-adams-child-care) (as of March), the site is a fraction of what was promised. -->

<!-- the city outsources its expertise, [relying on vendors](https://www.gothamgazette.com/130-opinion/11948-mayor-adams-nyc-it-tech-bureaucracy-mycity) who have no incentive to deliver quickly, cheaply, or without lock-in. -->

<!-- A theme of my work has been “helping tech teams work better,” ensuring strong engineering, product, design, and documentation practices to deliver excellent government services for everyone.

I have also been helping people learn to code for 15 years. I teach coding and data analysis for public policy at Columbia and NYU, helping students break down policy questions into actionable steps that can be answered with open data. -->

I know the Mamdani administration is going to do things better, and I want to be a part of it. I'm interested in a technology leadership role, where I can guide complex projects to become the [excellent services that New Yorkers deserve](https://techmayor.nyc/p/about-the-tech-mayor-project). This will include:

- [Bringing more engineers, designers, and product managers in-house](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1EFbzYUcDx7fWn0HMuNmEtmo0PBIU45qpGxjzAH1aO_k/edit?usp=sharing)
  - Rather than eliminating vendors, integrated teams can ensure the work is being done well.
- Empowering new and existing government staff (and frankly, vendors), ensuring they have what they need to do their best work
- Always doing what's best for the users/public, basing decisions on research and data
- Increasing the commitment to open source and open data

Thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely,

Aidan Feldman
